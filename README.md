# gtr (just three letters I could type quickly... but I guess it means "Great Test-framework for finding Regressions"?)
A testing framework for working with the learning compiler in CMPT379 at SFU with Tom Shermer

I built it around my work-flow:
- make new tests, and open them automatically for editing
- accept the results of a test without explicitly moving files around
- run as many tests in parallel as possible on your system
- view the difference between the result of a test an expectation without knowing the paths for the associated files

currently this tool won't work on windows, but feel free to fork it and change that.
